**Quote It Rails** 
===================
**Live demo**: https://quoteit-zaingz.herokuapp.com/

Quote it is a social platform for sharing quotes and wise sayings. It is a great place to share and spread the wisdom and intellect. 



Features
-------------
**Quote it** is under development at the moment. I am working hard to bring it to general audience as soon as possible. If you are interested in this app then feel free to `fork` this repo. I can handover this project to you if you want to work on it.

> **Current features:**

> - Users Login through Facebook and twitter
> - A list of all the quotes created by users.
>- Posting a new quote.
>- Owner can delete their quotes
>- Front-end is written in ReactJs



There are number of features which are missing from this app right now. But I have short listed few of them like following people etc. **I will encourage other developers to help me completing this app**.
